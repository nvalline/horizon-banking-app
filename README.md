### What I learned

In this project I learned several new tools and techniques. I learned how to structure my TypeScript better in a more succinct manner. I also learned how to implement Appwrite for its Auth and database uses, Plaid for secure bank account accessibility, and Dwolla for bank transactions. In addition, I utilized ShadCN and Chart.js in additional ways to grow upon my front end skills.

### Continued development

I am excited to continue to learn new tools and techniques to build bigger and better applications.
